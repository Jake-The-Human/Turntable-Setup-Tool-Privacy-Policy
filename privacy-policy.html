      <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
      <p>This privacy policy applies to the Turntable Setup Tool app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Jake Adamson (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an **Ad Supported service**. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

      <br><strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
      <p>While the Application itself does not directly collect personally identifiable information, it uses **third-party advertising and diagnostics services (Google AdMob)**. These services automatically collect data, including but not limited to:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>**Device ID (Advertising ID)** and **IP address** for advertising.</li>
             <li>**Crash logs**, **Diagnostics**, and **Other app performance data** for analyzing app stability, ensuring functionality, and fraud prevention.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>This data is used for the purpose of serving personalized advertisements and improving app performance and stability.</p>

      <br><strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong>
      <p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

      <br><strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
      <p>Yes. Data collected by the AdMob service, as described above, is shared with **Google** and their associated ad partners for the purposes of serving and analyzing advertisements and diagnostics.</p>

      <br><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
      <p>You can stop all future collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. Additionally, you may **opt-out of interest-based advertising** by adjusting your device settings (e.g., reset advertising ID, enable "Limit Ad Tracking").</p>
      
      <br><strong>Children</strong>
      <p>The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (flaky.shakespeare@gmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

      <br><strong>Security</strong>
      <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. All user data collected by the third-party services is **encrypted in transit (using HTTPS/TLS)**. However, since the Application only uses third-party services for data collection (AdMob/Diagnostics), we rely on their security protocols to protect data.</p>
      
      <br><strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
      <p>The Service Provider does not retain any user data collected by the Application. Data collected by the third-party AdMob SDK is retained by Google in accordance with their data retention policies. **The Service Provider ensures any limited diagnostic or usage data created and collected internally is automatically deleted after 90 days.**</p>

      <br><strong>Changes</strong>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

      <br>
      <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-11-14</p>
      
      <br><strong>Your Consent</strong>
      <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.</p>

      <br><strong>Contact Us</strong>
      <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at flaky.shakespeare@gmail.com.</p>
